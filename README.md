# AIRS: AI Editor Rules Standard

AIRS (AI Editor Rules Standard) is a company-agnostic standard for defining custom rules, instructions, and prompts for AI coding assistants and language models integrated into development environments. It draws inspiration from the features and concepts found in the rule systems of editors such as Cursor (Project Rules, `.cursorrules`), VS Code (Instructions/Prompt Files), and Cline (`.clinerules`), among others. The goal is to foster interoperability, reusability, and clarity when guiding AI behavior across different tools and projects.
